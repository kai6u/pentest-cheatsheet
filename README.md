## Description
The pentest-cheatsheet is an xmind-based Graphical CheatSheet created to serve as a reference when doing Boot2Root-style CTFs and Penetration Tests.
The basic concept is to describe the procedure for each Windows/Linux OS by dividing the flow from Recon to Exploit to obtain the user flag and the Privilege Escalation procedure to obtain the root flag.
